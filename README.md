Quant Project 2 - Option Pricing and Delta Hedging

This project implements option pricing using the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations. It also evaluates delta-hedging strategies and quantifies hedging errors under various rebalancing intervals.

## üìä Features
- Closed-form Black-Scholes pricing for European options
- Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European & Asian options
- Calculation of Greeks (Delta, Gamma)
- Delta Hedging simulation under discrete rebalancing
- Visualization of hedging error and PnL over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Quantitative Finance concepts
